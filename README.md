App Service Helpers (ASH) makes it as easy as possible to add data storage and authentication to your mobile app with Microsoft's Azure App Service Platform. ASH was built with the mobile developer in mind, and requires no previous experience with backends as a service (BaaS).

In just four lines of code, you can connect your app to the cloud with online/offline synchronization and automatic conflict resolution. Authenticating users with Facebook, Twitter, Google, Microsoft accounts, Azure AD, and Azure B2C is dead simple as well - just one line of code. ASH even takes care of securely storing access tokens and refreshing them regularly, with no extra effort required from you.

App Service Helpers was developed as a supplemental library to Microsoft's Azure Client SDK. Rather than replacing this library, ASH extends it by lowering the barrier to entry for developers who wish to build cloud-connected mobile apps in C#. If you ever find yourself outgrowing App Service Helpers, you can drop down to a lower level with the Microsoft Azure Client SDK for fine-tuned control or even remove ASH with minimal refactoring.

#### AppService.Helpers
App Service Helpers makes it as easy as possible to add a backend to your mobile application. In just four lines of code, you can create a cloud-connected mobile app with online/offline synchronization and automatic conflict handling, so that your app continues to function even if the user loses network connectivity. App Service Helpers also comes with a preconfigured Xamarin.Forms ViewModel, so that you can bind directly to your data without having to write any additional code.

## Getting Started
### Add App Service Helpers
Configuring data access in your mobile apps with App Service Helpers is easy. Simply add the App Service Helpers NuGet, initialize the library, pass in your Azure mobile appâ€™s URL, register a data model as a table, and finalize the schema, as seen below:
###
```c#
using AppServiceHelpers;
 
// 1. Create a new EasyMobileServiceClient.
var client = EasyMobileServiceClient.Create();
 
// 2. Initialize the library with the URL of the Azure Mobile App you created in Step #1.
// Example: http://appservicehelpers.azurewebsites.net
client.Initialize("{Your_Mobile_App_Backend_Url_Here");
 
// 3. Register a model with the EasyMobileServiceClient to create a table.
client.RegisterTable<TodoItem>();
 
// 4. Finalize the schema for our database. All table registrations must be done before this step.
client.FinalizeSchema();
```
#### AppService.Helpers.Forms
The Forms package is an extra download that unlocks a ViewModel base class that allows you to bind from XAML to Azure tables with minimal configuration on your end (just a couple of lines of code). 

App Service Helpers for Xamarin.Forms includes a preconfigured view model that handles all communication with the EasyMobileServiceClient to help you get started fast. Add the App Service Helpers for Xamarin.Forms NuGet and subclass the BaseAzureViewModel:

```c#
using AppServiceHelpers.Forms
 
public class TodoItemsViewModel : BaseFormsViewModel<TodoItem>
{
        public TodoItemsViewModel(IEasyMobileServiceClient client) : base (client) { }
}
```
